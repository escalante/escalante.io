Being an open-source project, the Escalante community has many entry-points.
You're welcome to participate via one or several, depending on your level of
interest.

Some activities, like filing bugs in our issue tracker, require that you have
a JBoss Community account. Signing up for a JBoss Community account is easy.

## IRC

The Escalante team is a distributed team, so you can be as close to the action
as anyone else by participating on IRC.  IRC is our virtual office
(and virtual watercooler) so fire up an IRC client and stop in.

[`irc.freenode.net #escalante`](irc://irc.freenode.net/escalante)

If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the
[web chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=escalante) interface.

## User Forum

Escalante's user forum is located in [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).
To ask a question, use the [`escalante` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/escalante).

## Issue Tracker

We track our issues in our JBoss Community [issue tracker](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ESC).
Reporting or commenting on issues requires [signing up for a JBoss Community account](https://community.jboss.org/login.jspa)
, but no account is required to browse issues.

### Bugs

Bugs are what happens when it just doesn't work the way you'd expect it to.
Particularly so if we've implied that your expectations are correct through
documentation or examples.

Many bugs reveal themselves in very peculiar circumstances that we have not
tested for. So when you're telling us about a bug, include as much information
as possible. Include details about your operating system, your Java version,
your networking environment, whatever you think might help.

If you want your bug fixed really fast, you'll include with your bug report a
link to a [git repo](http://github.com/) containing a small test case
demonstrating the problem. We love those kinds of bug reports!

### Features

Feature requests are always welcome. We expect Escalante to support many
different use-cases, but we're sure we have not thought of them all.

Let us know what you wish you could do with Escalante, and we'll look at
getting it on the roadmap. It may not necessarily be "soon", but knowing what
everyone wants can only help us in our planning.

## Developer Google Group

The [Escalante developer Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/escalante-dev)
is where the developers discuss internal designs, choices and complexity.
If you are interested in the inner workings and how they are built, the
developer list is an excellent resource.

Since the developers also participate on the user list, there is no need to
initiate bug reports on the developer list. The developers will escalate true
defects to the developer list to determine the proper course of action.

### Archives

Escalante developer discussions were previously done in a mailing list called
`escalante-dev`. These discussions are archived in both
[MarkMail](http://escalante.markmail.org/search/?q=)
 and [Nabble](http://escalante-developer-list.1065539.n5.nabble.com/).
