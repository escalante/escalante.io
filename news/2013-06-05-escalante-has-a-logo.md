Yayy!! After months of waiting, Escalante finally has a logo. Many thanks to
the JBoss design team, and Cheyenne in particular, for creating such an
awesome logo.

The logo represents either a pyramid or mountain, depending on which side you
look at. It's a very nice visual trick. On the left, the pyramid with the
stairs and on the right, the mountain, both of which we encourage you to
climb :). This is precisely what the name 'Escalante' means, something
that's climbing or ascending.

In the next few weeks the website's design will change to adopt
the logo and style.
