We're pleased to announce the next official release of Escalante
- version **`0.3.0`**. We consider this release to be beta quality,
and lacks some of the features and API stability that will end up in the
1.0.0 release.

## What is Escalante?

If this is the first time you've ever heard of Escalante, check out our
[FAQ](/faq) section to find out more about Escalante.

## What's in this release?

The main focus of this release has been adding support for
[Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) 2.1 scala web applications
to Escalante. This means that Play 2.1 applications can be built, deployed
and run on top of Escalante just like a normal Play application but with
[some limitations](/docs). To help Play users deploy applications on top of
Escalante, [quickstart applications](/quickstarts) have been developed and
these are the best starting point.

Here's a summary of other highlights of this release:

* **Lift integration has been enhanced in order to support
[Lift 2.5](http://liftweb.net/25) applications**. The "Hello World" Lift
quickstart has been upgraded to use Lift 2.5, but the other Lift quickstarts
remain using Lift 2.4. This has been done on purpouse so that different Lift
quickstarts can demonstrate not only different functionality, but they can
also demonstrate that **Lift applications can be deployed on top of Escalante,
side by side, even if they use different Lift and/or Scala versions!**

* **Escalante SBT plugin version `0.2.0` has been released** with added support
for Play applications to be built, deployed and run on top of Escalante.
In order to avoid [issues](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/647) with
Escalante SBT plugin, please follow the methods shown in the quickstarts on
[how to define the Escalante SBT plugin
version](https://github.com/escalante/escalante-quickstart/blob/0.3.0/helloworld-play/project/project/Plugins.scala)
to use.

* Escalante Quickstarts have now been tagged for version
[`0.3.0`](https://github.com/escalante/escalante-quickstart/tree/0.3.0) and the
great news is **two new Escalante Play Quickstarts have been added** with SBT
build files. Also, the SBT based quickstarts now define the Escalante SBT
plugin dependency via Git URI in order to avoid the dependency resolution
issue on SBT/Ivy mentioned earlier.

## What's next?

In next release, Escalante will be moving to being based on top of
[Widlfly](http://www.wildfly.org/) and both Lift and Play integrations will be
further enhanced. If there's anything in particular you'd like to see done
with regards to Lift or Play integration, [let us know|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/escalante-dev]!
